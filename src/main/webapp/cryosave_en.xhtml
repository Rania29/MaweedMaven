                <h2>BECOMING A PARENT IS A LIFETIME RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
                <p>As a parent protecting your family is top priority. You can take the first step by saving your baby’s cord blood. Cord blood comes from the newborns umbilical cord and can be collected immediately after birth.</p>
                <h2>CORD BLOOD BANKING</h2>
                <p>Cord blood banking is a once-in-lifetime opportunity for you to collect and save stem cells from your baby’s umbilical cord blood. Having this valuable resource can be life-saving or life-changing for your baby and other family members.</p>
                <h2>CORD BLOOD: TOO VALUABLE TO BE WASTED</h2>
                <p>Your baby’s cord blood is a rich source of powerful stem cells which come from your newborns umbilical cord and can be collected immediately after birth. After the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut, the remaining blood in the umbilical cord is drown into the collection bag by your healthcare provider.</p>
                <h2>WHAT MAKES CORD BLOOD CELLS DIFFERENT?</h2>
                <p>Cord blood stem cells are biologically younger and more flexible compared to adult stem cells from other sources like bone marrow. When saved, they have unique qualities and advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Collection of cord blood is simple, safe and painless.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preserving them (stops the clock) and protect the cells from aging and being exposed to environmental factors and common viruses that can decrease their functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Immediately available and can minimize disease progression in early treatment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduces risk of complications when used in transplants.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to uses one’s own stem cells for conditions that currently lack medical treatment options, also known as “autologous transplant”.
